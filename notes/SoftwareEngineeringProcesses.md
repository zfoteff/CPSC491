Software Engineering Processes
===================

# Two main Approaches
Waterfall
* Strict process with emphasis on completing each stage before the next
* Document driven
* Slow, methodical, thorough (when done correctly)

Agile
* Create a backlog of set of features/stories
    * Prioratized
    * Constantly refined
* Iterate on solution
    * Start with MVP

# Which is better
Model preferance generally depends of POV
* Manager?
* Developer?
* Executive?

Speed wins in the marketplace over quality
* People purchase by feature, not by quality
    * Quality has to exist at some defined minimum
    * Quality issues must be resolved quickly or customer trust is lost

## Executive
### Waterfall
* Communication: clarity and lots of details
* Time and budget: what do I get when and how much will it cost
* Control: I can almost completely control the outcome of the process

### Agile
* Communication clarity for next MVP, much less moving beyond
* Time and Budget: No Idea. You know what you need when you need it
* Control: Almost none

## Team
### Waterfall
* Long planning, design, requirement, and documentation process with lots of guessing
* Lots of oversight with heavy review processes
* Under promise - Over deliver
    * Are estimates contracts? They are estimates to developers, they are contracts to sponsors

### Agile
* Fast, incrimental, spend time on "real work"
* No guessing, do what you know, fix issues as they appear

# Waterfall Model
Requirements analysis -> Architectural Design -> Detailed Design -> Code & Testing -> System Testing  
To move from one step to another, each step must be completed in its entirety and with approval from executives or sponsors

## Advantages
* Each phase is clearly defined, with clear inputs/outputs
* Oversight can ensure high-quality at each stage
* Specialists can be experts at specific steps
    * Analysts, architects, developers, QA team

## Disadvantages
* No software until late in project
    * Release after system testing
* Force stable requirements early in projects
    * Changes mean backtracking
* Considerable overhead
    * Documentation, review, management
* Slow and rigid process

Variations on waterfall process can address some of these concerns
* Waterfall is just a proxy for "plan-driven" development

# OARP decision framework
Complex but thorough model to all for gatekeepers to control projects
* Owner: Single owner who is driving/delivering the project
* Approver:
    * Needed for approval at process "gates"
    * Two flavors: blocking and non-blocking
* Reviewers: Those requested to provided feedback (review)
* Participants: Team members participating in project
* OARPI:
    * Add informed to the list -- those informed of decision

# Spiral Model
Risk-based iterative model - generally seen in the final phases of a product development
* Four phases of working through the spiral
    * Phase 1: Determine objectives and alternatives
    * Phase 2: Identify and resolve risks
    * Phase 3: Develop and tests solutions to resolve risks iteratively
    * Phase 4: Plan next cycle
* Risks interpreted broadly
    * Poorly understood requirements, architecture, etc.
    * Performance, security
    * Missing features

## Advantages
* Least risky process - focus is elimanating risk
* Flexability: Functionality and requirements can change and be added
* Early deliverables

## Disadvantages
* Highly dependant on risk analysis
* Complicated
* Requires specific expertise

# Software Engineering Realities from Dan
Dan has worked at ~8-9 companies
* 2 Startups
* 2 Medium companies
* 5 Large corps

SE process is highly context dependant
* Business size
* Business context/focus
* Leadership + experience
* Market and competition
* Business liability of software
* Talent level

Analysis of SE process is generalized and context dependant
* Not enough data to be rigorous

SE process description and analysis is subjective
* Teams describe their process as the SE process of the closest fit
    * What teams describe and what they actually do rarely match

## Contexts
Business focus
* Is does the company sell software?
* Is software a critical component of what the company sells?
* Is software a component of what the company sells , but minor (installers, wizards)?
* Is software a support function (healthcare, manufacturing)?
* Does software mean IT?

Experience and Leadership
* The leaders for software development teams tend to drive descisions
* What have the leaders done before?
    * What do they prefer?
    * How experienced are they?

Team Size and Organization Depth
* The smaller the team, the more agile and flexible the team needs to be
* Software teams tend to run from enterprise level scaling

Talent Level
* Talented team members allows the greater team to be more flexible and 

Type of development
* Front-end: Can be more agile
* Back-end: Tends to need more architecture, planning, and testing

## Leadership and Talent 
Talent is a combination of
* IHP
* Education
* Training
* Intangibles 
    * ***Persistance***
    * Emotional intelligence
    * Communication
    * Writing
    * Speaking
    * Patents

Talent tends to be a proxy for IHP (Intellectual horsepower)
* Good poeple can overcome bad processes
* Good processes can mitigate lower talent levels

## Team size and Organization
How hierarchical is the team organized?
* Hierarchies tend to require more communication
* Each level will want their own control over project processes

Is the team flat & more egalitarian
* Flat organizations tend to delegate more
* Leaders are enablers, not controllers

Overall generalization
* Small teams are easier and more efficient than large teams
* Communication is easier in smaller teams
* Large teams require more overhead
    * Additional emails, meetings, reviews, strategies, education, etc
* Large teams become more authoritative

Clarity and Politics
* Achieving clarity is more difficult the more people involved

Outside parties
* Customers, architects, sponsors, marketing, sales, and others can have an impact on project direction
