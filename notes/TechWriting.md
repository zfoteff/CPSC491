Technical Writing for 491 and 499
===========
## Whats the point?
* What should reader remember
* What is the secondary points
## Are you making a claim?
* Ex. "Software development is an iterative process"
* Is it substantiated
## Can a word/phrase/sentence be removed without losing clarity?
* If yes -> 86 it
## Never duplicate a point you've already made
* It is a waste of time
* You wont have to correct every instance of the point should it be proven false
## Conciseness
## Facts, not opinions
* Always have data when you can
* State an opinion when one is used

# Preposition
* Specifies a relationship between two things
* Specifices relative time between two things/events

**Never end sentences in prepositions**

Ex: "The project was the most difficult project I ever worked on"
* Ok: "The project was the most difficult project on which I have ever worked"
* Better: "The project was my most difficult project"

Ex: "The team members were the best partners I could work with"
* Ok: "The team members were the best partners with whom I could work"
* Better: "The team contained the best partners"

# Transitions and Conjunctions
Transitions: Connect sentences
* However, thus, therefore, though
* b/w two independant clauses

Conjuctions:
* Connects words or phrases in sentence
* And, or, but

**Never start sentence with a conjunction**  
**Never start sentence with a transition**

# Adverbs and Adjectives
Avoid using adverbs and adjectives in general  
Always avoid using superlatives
* Best, worst, favorite, huge, tiny

# Voice
Use *active* voice whenever possible
* Active voice: actor + verb + target
* Passive: target + verb + actor

# Verbs
Chose strong verbs over weak verbs
* Weak: Often ensures passive voice
    * was, were, is, am
* Strong: Often ensures strong voice (actor+verb+target)

Ex: "There are many occurances of the data pattern in the store"
* Avoid "there is" and "there are", too indirect
* Ok: "The data pattern occurs many times in the store"
* Better: "The patterns repeats often in the data"

# Acronyms
Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.  
Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
* The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
* The acronym appears many times in the document
Define acronyms by bolding both the full name and the acronym name
* Ex: "Thats product is already **Dead On Arrival** (**DOA**)"

# Sentences
Technical writers use short sentences.
* Sentences should convey a single idea at a time (no conjunction)
* Use lists instead of long setences (bullet points)
* Reflect on the desired implications of a phrase when considering its removal 
* More words = More chances for those words to degrade the intended meaning of the phrase

# Paragraphs
Start paragraph with the point that you want the reader to take away
* Paragraphs should have their own point/topic

Clearly articulate what, why, and how of the paragraph
* What: What am I talking about 
* Why: Why am I talking about this to this person. Why should I care? Why should they care?
* How: Support arguments with data/facts/arguments that relate to the point

## Idioms and Culture referances
Don't
