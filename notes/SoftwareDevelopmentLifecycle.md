Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
================

Multistage approach to the software development  
Key stages:
* Planning 
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Operations/Management

These stages can be rearranged to create different Software Engineering proceesses (Waterfall, Agile)

# Kanban
Based on placing sticky notes on a board  
Loses notion of a sprint, or a clear time frame for the project iteration  
The board is split into columns and rows
* Rows: Swimlanes
    * Can include categories of work like devops and testers
* Columns: Categories

Major focuses: 
* What are we doing right now (WIP)
* What are the limitations of the work

Key Terms:
* Pull model: Tasks are taken or pulled from board
* Cycle time: Key metric measuring how long it takes items to complete the flow
* Cadence: Coninuous workflow and continous integration
    * Ship when ready, always have a releasable candidate if possible

Unfinished items drop back into todo on significant blockers

# Scrum V. Kanban
* Both agile
* Both have standups/retros/reviews
* Both prioratize task and stories
* Scrum = Push  :   Kanban = Pull
* Scrum
    * Prioratizes getting as many stories done before the end of a sprint
    * Breaks work into digestable chunks
    * Stories/tasks are assigned
* Kanban
    * Focus is WIP
    * Task are worked on until they are completed
    * Tasks are pulled from board
